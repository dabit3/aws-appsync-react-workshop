### Topics we'll be covering:

- [Authentication](https://github.com/dabit3/aws-amplify-workshop-react#adding-authentication)
- [GraphQL API with AWS AppSync](https://github.com/dabit3/aws-amplify-workshop-react#adding-a-graphql-api)
- [Multiple Environments](https://github.com/dabit3/aws-amplify-workshop-react#working-with-multiple-environments)
- [Deploying via the Amplify Console](https://github.com/dabit3/aws-amplify-workshop-react#amplify-console)
- [Removing / Deleting Services](https://github.com/dabit3/aws-amplify-workshop-react#removing-services)

## Getting Started - Creating the React Application

To get started, we first need to create a new React project & change into the new directory using the [Create React App CLI](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

If you already have this installed, skip to the next step. If not, either install the CLI & create the app or create a new app using npx:

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app my-amplify-app
```

Or use npx (npm 5.2 & later) to create a new app:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-amplify-app
```

Now change into the new app directory & install the AWS Amplify & AWS Amplify React libraries:

```bash
cd my-amplify-app
npm install --save aws-amplify aws-amplify-react
# or
yarn add aws-amplify aws-amplify-react
```

## Installing the CLI & Initializing a new AWS Amplify Project

### Installing the CLI

Next, we'll install the AWS Amplify CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

Now we need to configure the CLI with our credentials:

```js
amplify configure
```

> If you'd like to see a video walkthrough of this configuration process, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWbM5DLh25U).

Here we'll walk through the `amplify configure` setup. Once you've signed in to the AWS console, continue:
- Specify the AWS Region: __eu-central-1__
- Specify the username of the new IAM user: __amplify-workshop-user__
> In the AWS Console, click __Next: Permissions__, __Next: Tags__, __Next: Review__, & __Create User__ to create the new IAM user. Then, return to the command line & press Enter.
- Enter the access key of the newly created user:   
  accessKeyId: __(<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>)__   
  secretAccessKey:  __(<YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>)__
- Profile Name: __amplify-workshop-user__

### Initializing A New Project

```bash
amplify init
```

- Enter a name for the project: __amplifyreactapp__
- Enter a name for the environment: __dev__
- Choose your default editor: __Visual Studio Code (or your default editor)__   
- Please choose the type of app that you're building __javascript__   
- What javascript framework are you using __react__   
- Source Directory Path: __src__   
- Distribution Directory Path: __build__   
- Build Command: __npm run-script build__   
- Start Command: __npm run-script start__   
- Do you want to use an AWS profile? __Y__
- Please choose the profile you want to use: __amplify-workshop-user__

Now, the AWS Amplify CLI has iniatilized a new project & you will see a new folder: __amplify__. The files in this folder hold your project configuration.


## Adding Authentication

To add authentication, we can use the following command:

```sh
amplify add auth
```

> When prompted for __Do you want to use default authentication and security configuration?__, choose __Yes__

Now, we'll run the push command and the cloud resources will be created in our AWS account.

```bash
amplify push
```

> To view the new Cognito authentication service at any time after its creation, go to the dashboard at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/). Also be sure that your region is set correctly.

### Configuring the React applicaion

Now, our resources are created & we can start using them!

The first thing we need to do is to configure our React application to be aware of our new AWS Amplify project. We can do this by referencing the auto-generated `aws-exports.js` file that is now in our src folder.

To configure the app, open __src/index.js__ and add the following code below the last import:

```js
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify'
import config from './aws-exports'
Amplify.configure(config)
```

Now, our app is ready to start using our AWS services.

### Using the withAuthenticator component

To add authentication, we'll go into __src/App.js__ and first import the `withAuthenticator` HOC (Higher Order Component) from `aws-amplify-react`:

```js
import { withAuthenticator } from 'aws-amplify-react'
```

Next, we'll wrap our default export (the App component) with the `withAuthenticator` HOC:

```js
export default withAuthenticator(App, { includeGreetings: true })
```

Now, we can run the app and see that an Authentication flow has been added in front of our App component. This flow gives users the ability to sign up & sign in.

> To view the new user that was created in Cognito, go back to the dashboard at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/). Also be sure that your region is set correctly.

### Accessing User Data

We can access the user's info now that they are signed in by calling `Auth.currentAuthenticatedUser()`.

```js
import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify'

async componentDidMount() {
  const user = await Auth.currentAuthenticatedUser()
  console.log('user info:', user.signInUserSession.idToken.payload)
  console.log('username:', user.username)
}
```

### Custom authentication strategies

The `withAuthenticator` component is a really easy way to get up and running with authentication, but in a real-world application we probably want more control over how our form looks & functions.

Let's look at how we might create our own authentication flow.

To get started, we would probably want to create input fields that would hold user input data in the state. For instance when signing up a new user, we would probably need 4 user inputs to capture the user's username, email, password, & phone number.

To do this, we could create some initial state for these values & create an event handler that we could attach to the form inputs:

```js
// initial state
state = {
  username: '', password: '', email: '', phone_number: ''
}

// event handler
onChange = (event) => {
  this.setState({ [event.target.name]: event.target.value })
}

// example of usage with input
<input
  name='username'
  placeholder='username'
  onChange={this.onChange}
/>
```

We'd also need to have a method that signed up & signed in users. We can us the Auth class to do thi. The Auth class has over 30 methods including things like `signUp`, `signIn`, `confirmSignUp`, `confirmSignIn`, & `forgotPassword`. Thes functions return a promise so they need to be handled asynchronously.

```js
// import the Auth component
import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify'

// Class method to sign up a user
signUp = async() => {
  const { username, password, email, phone_number } = this.state
  try {
    await Auth.signUp({ username, password, attributes: { email, phone_number }})
  } catch (err) {
    console.log('error signing up user...', err)
  }
}
```

## Adding a GraphQL API

To add a GraphQL API, we can use the following command:

```sh
amplify add api
```

Answer the following questions

- Please select from one of the above mentioned services __GraphQL__   
- Provide API name: __GraphqlMeetup__   
- Choose an authorization type for the API __API key__   
- Do you have an annotated GraphQL schema? __N__   
- Do you want a guided schema creation? __Y__   
- What best describes your project: __Single object with fields (e.g. “Todo” with ID, name, description)__   
- Do you want to edit the schema now? (Y/n) __Y__   

> When prompted, update the schema to the following:   

```graphql
type Talk @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String
  speakerName: String!
  speakerBio: String
}
```

> Next, let's push the configuration to our account:

```bash
amplify push
```

- Do you want to generate code for your newly created GraphQL API __Y__
- Choose the code generation language target: __JavaScript__
- Enter the file name pattern of graphql queries, mutations and subscriptions: __(src/graphql/**/*.js)__
- Do you want to generate/update all possible GraphQL operations - queries, mutations and subscriptions? __Y__

> To view the new AWS AppSync API at any time after its creation, go to the dashboard at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/appsync](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appsync). Also be sure that your region is set correctly.

### Adding mutations from within the AWS AppSync Console

In the AWS AppSync console, open your API & then click on Queries.

Execute the following mutation to create a new talk in the API:

```graphql
mutation createTalk {
  createTalk(input: {
    name: "Full Stack React"
    description: "Using React to build Full Stack Apps with GraphQL"
    speakerName: "Nader"
    speakerBio: "Some guy"
  }) {
    id name description speakerName speakerBio
  }
}
```

Now, let's query for the talk:

```graphql
query listTalks {
  listTalks {
    items {
      id
      name
      description
      speakeName
      speakerBio
    }
  }
}
```

We can even add search / filter capabilities when querying:

```graphql
query listTalks {
  listTalks(filter: {
    description: {
      contains: "React"
    }
  }) {
    items {
      id
      name
      description
      speakeName
      speakerBio
    }
  }
}
```

### Interacting with the GraphQL API from our client application - Querying for data

Now that the GraphQL API is created we can begin interacting with it!

The first thing we'll do is perform a query to fetch data from our API.

To do so, we need to define the query, execute the query, store the data in our state, then list the items in our UI.


```js
// imports from Amplify library
import { API, graphqlOperation } from 'aws-amplify'

// import query
import { listTalks as ListPets } from './graphql/queries'

// define some state to hold the data returned from the API
state = {
  pets: []
}

// execute the query in componentDidMount
async componentDidMount() {
  try {
    const pets = await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(ListPets))
    console.log('pets:', pets)
    this.setState({
      pets: pets.data.listPets.items
    })
  } catch (err) {
    console.log('error fetching pets...', err)
  }
}

// add UI in render method to show data
  {
    this.state.pets.map((pet, index) => (
      <div key={index}>
        <h3>{pet.name}</h3>
        <p>{pet.description}</p>
      </div>
    ))
  }
```

## Performing mutations

 Now, let's look at how we can create mutations.

```js
// import the mutation
import { createPet as CreatePet } from './graphql/mutations'

// create initial state
state = {
  name: '', description: '', pets: []
}

createPet = async() => {
  const { name, description } = this.state
  if (name === '') return
  let pet = { name }
  if (description !== '') {
    pet = { ...pet, description }
  }
  const updatedPetArray = [...this.state.pets, pet]
  this.setState({ pets: updatedPetArray })
  try {
    await API.graphql(graphqlOperation(CreatePet, { input: pet }))
    console.log('item created!')
  } catch (err) {
    console.log('error creating pet...', err)
  }
}

// change state then user types into input
onChange = (event) => {
  this.setState({
    [event.target.name]: event.target.value
  })
}

// add UI with event handlers to manage user input
<input
  name='name'
  onChange={this.onChange}
  value={this.state.name}
/>
<input
  name='description'
  onChange={this.onChange}
  value={this.state.description}
/>
<button onClick={this.createPet}>Create Pet</button>
```

### GraphQL Subscriptions

Next, let's see how we can create a subscription to subscribe to changes of data in our API.

To do so, we need to define the subscription, listen for the subscription, & update the state whenever a new piece of data comes in through the subscription.

```js
// import the subscription
import { onCreatePet as OnCreatePet } from './graphql/subscriptions'

// subscribe in componentDidMount
API.graphql(
  graphqlOperation(OnCreatePet)
).subscribe({
    next: (eventData) => {
      console.log('eventData', eventData)
      const pet = eventData.value.data.onCreatePet
      const pets = [
        ...this.state.pets.filter(p => {
          const val1 = p.name + p.description
          const val2 = pet.name + pet.description
          return val1 !== val2
        }),
        pet
      ]
      this.setState({ pets })
    }
});
```

### Adding Authorization to the GraphQL API (Advanced, optional)

To add authorization to the API, we can re-configure the API to use our cognito identity pool. To do so, we can run `amplify configure api`:

```sh
amplify configure api
```
Please select from one of the below mentioned services: __GraphQL__
Choose an authorization type for the API: __Amazon Cognito User Pool__

Next, we'll run `amplify push`:

```sh
amplify push
```

Now, we can only access the API with a logged in user.

_Let's how how we can access the user's identity in the resolver._

To do so, open the AWS AppSync dashboard for the API, click __Schema__, & open the resolver for the `createPet` mutation.

Here in the __Request mapping template__, update the resolver to add the following:

```js
$util.qr($context.args.input.put("userId", $context.identity.sub))
$util.qr($context.args.input.put("username", $context.identity.username))
```

Now when we create items, the user's identity is stored with each request.

Next, we need to add an index on the table holding the pet data. Open the Data Sources tab & click on the DynamoDB table link. From the DynamoDB table view, click on __indexes__ & __Create Index__.

Here, create a new index. The partition key should be __userId__ & the index name needs to be __userId-index__.

We can now query on the userId index, only fetching data for the logged-in user:

```js
{
    "version" : "2017-02-28",
    "operation" : "Query",
    "index": "userId-index",
    "query" : {
        "expression": "userId = :userId",
        "expressionValues" : {
            ":userId" : $util.dynamodb.toDynamoDBJson($ctx.identity.sub)
        }
    }
}
```

## Working with Storage

To add storage, we can use the following command:

```sh
amplify add storage
```

> Answer the following questions   

- Please select from one of the below mentioned services __Content (Images, audio, video, etc.)__
- Please provide a friendly name for your resource that will be used to label this category in the
 project: __YOURAPINAME__
- Please provide bucket name: __YOURUNIQUEBUCKETNAME__
- Who should have access: __Auth users only__
- What kind of access do you want for Authenticated users __read/write__   


```sh
amplify push
```

Now, storage is configured & ready to use.

What we've done above is created configured an Amazon S3 bucket that we can now start using for storing items.

For example, if we wanted to test it out we could store some text in a file like this:

```js
import { Storage } from 'aws-amplify'

// create function to work with Storage
addToStorage = () => {
  Storage.put('javascript/MyReactComponent.js', `
    import React from 'react'
    const App = () => (
      <p>Hello World</p>
    )
    export default App
  `)
    .then (result => {
      console.log('result: ', result)
    })
    .catch(err => console.log('error: ', err));
}

// add click handler
<button onClick={this.addToStorage}>Add To Storage</button>
```

This would create a folder called `javascript` in our S3 bucket & store a file called __MyReactComponent.js__ there with the code we specified in the second argument of `Storage.put`.

> To view the new S3 Bucket at any time after its creation, go to the dashboard at [https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home).

If we want to read everything from this folder, we can use `Storage.list`:

```js
readFromStorage = () => {
  Storage.list('javascript/')
    .then(data => console.log('data from S3: ', data))
    .catch(err => console.log('error'))
}
```

If we only want to read the single file, we can use `Storage.get`:

```js
readFromStorage = () => {
  Storage.get('javascript/MyReactComponent.js')
    .then(data => console.log('data from S3: ', data))
    .catch(err => console.log('error'))
}
```

If we wanted to pull down everything, we can use `Storage.list`:

```js
readFromStorage = () => {
  Storage.list('')
    .then(data => console.log('data from S3: ', data))
    .catch(err => console.log('error'))
}
```

### Working with images

Working with images is also easy:

```js
class S3ImageUpload extends React.Component {
  onChange(e) {
      const file = e.target.files[0];
      Storage.put('example.png', file, {
          contentType: 'image/png'
      })
      .then (result => console.log(result))
      .catch(err => console.log(err));
  }

  render() {
      return (
          <input
              type="file" accept='image'
              onChange={(e) => this.onChange(e)}
          />
      )
  }
}

```

We can even use the S3Album component, one of a few components in the AWS Amplify React library to create a preconfigured photo picker:

```js
import { S3Album, withAuthenticator } from 'aws-amplify-react'

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <S3Album path={''} picker />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Hosting

To deploy & host your app on AWS, we can use the `hosting` category.

```sh
amplify add hosting
```

- Select the environment setup: __DEV (S3 only with HTTP)__
- hosting bucket name __YOURBUCKETNAME__
- index doc for the website __index.html__
- error doc for the website __index.html__

Now, everything is set up & we can publish it:

```sh
amplify publish
```

## Working with multiple environments

You can create multiple environments for your application in which to create & test out new features without affecting the main environment which you are working on.

When you create a new environment from an existing environment, you are given a copy of the entire backend application stack from the original project. When you make changes in the new environment, you are then able to test these new changes in the new environment & merge only the changes that have been made since the new environment was created back into the original environment.

Let's take a look at how to create a new environment. In this new environment, we'll re-configure the GraphQL Schema to have another field for the pet owner.

First, we'll initialize a new environment using `amplify init`:

```sh
amplify init
```

- Do you want to use an existing environment? __N__
- Enter a name for the environment: __apiupdate__
- Do you want to use an AWS profile? __Y__
- __amplify-workshop-user__

Once the new environment is initialized, we should be able to see some information about our environment setup by running:

```sh
amplify env list

| Environments |
| ------------ |
| dev          |
| *apiupdate   |
```

Now we can update the GraphQL Schema in `amplify/backend/api/GraphQLPets/schema.graphql` to the following (adding the owner field):

```graphql
type Pet @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  description: String
  owner: String
}
```

Now, we can create this new stack by running `amplify push`:

```sh
amplify push
```

After we test it out, we can now merge it into our original dev environment:

```sh
amplify env checkout dev

amplify status

amplify push
```

- Do you want to update code for your updated GraphQL API? __Y__
- Do you want to generate GraphQL statements? __Y__


## Deploying via the Amplify Console

We have looked at deploying via the Amplify CLI hosting category, but what about if we wanted continous deployment? For this, we can use the [Amplify Console](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/console/) to deploy the application.

The first thing we need to do is [create a new GitHub repo](https://github.com/new) for this project. Once we've created the repo, we'll copy the URL for the project to the clipboard & initialize git in our local project:

```sh
git init

git remote add origin git@github.com:username/project-name.git

git add .

git commit -m 'initial commit'

git push origin master
```

Next we'll visit the Amplify Console in our AWS account at [https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home).

Here, we'll click __Get Started__ to create a new deployment. Next, authorize Github as the repository service.

Next, we'll choose the new repository & branch for the project we just created & click __Next__.

In the next screen, we'll create a new role & use this role to allow the Amplify Console to deploy these resources & click __Next__.

Finally, we can click __Save and Deploy__ to deploy our application!

Now, we can push updates to Master to update our application.


## Adding Analytics

To add analytics, we can use the following command:

```sh
amplify add analytics
```

> Next, we'll be prompted for the following:

- Provide your pinpoint resource name: __amplifyanalytics__   
- Apps need authorization to send analytics events. Do you want to allow guest/unauthenticated users to send analytics events (recommended when getting started)? __Y__   
- overwrite YOURFILEPATH-cloudformation-template.yml __Y__

### Recording events

Now that the service has been created we can now begin recording events.

To record analytics events, we need to import the `Analytics` class from Amplify & then call `Analytics.record`:

```js
import { Analytics } from 'aws-amplify'

state = {username: ''}

async componentDidMount() {
  try {
    const user = await Auth.currentAuthenticatedUser()
    this.setState({ username: user.username })
  } catch (err) {
    console.log('error getting user: ', err)
  }
}

recordEvent = () => {
  Analytics.record({
    name: 'My test event',
    attributes: {
      username: this.state.username
    }
  })
}

<button onClick={this.recordEvent}>Record Event</button>
```

## Removing Services

If at any time, or at the end of this workshop, you would like to delete a service from your project & your account, you can do this by running the `amplify remove` command:

```sh
amplify remove auth

amplify push
```

If you are unsure of what services you have enabled at any time, you can run the `amplify status` command:

```sh
amplify status
```

`amplify status` will give you the list of resources that are currently enabled in your app.
